# Knights and Knaves Puzzle Solver: CS50 AI Project

This project is an AI-based solver for the "Knights and Knaves" puzzles, inspired by Raymond Smullyan's 1978 book. It's part of the CS50 AI course's exploration into logic and AI.

## Puzzle Concept

In "Knights and Knaves" puzzles, characters are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie. The AI solver determines each character's type based on their statements.

## Solution Approach

The solver employs propositional logic and a model-checking algorithm to logically assess the truthfulness of statements and identify the nature of each character.
